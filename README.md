# backpack-radiation-detector-architecture
This system architecture aims to define a clear, modular, and traceable structure for a portable, backpack-sized nuclear material detection system capable of operating in crowded, urban environments. This architecture will support rapid detection and classification of radioactive sources, enable reliable alerting and communication, and ensure ease of integration with future enhancements.

The architecture will be developed using SysML to model system structure, behavior, and requirements traceability. It will be guided by principles from ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 to address stakeholder concerns and selectively aligned with DoDAF views to facilitate compatibility with defense acquisition and operational standards.

This initial architecture will provide a foundational system development and validation model and will be structured to enable future refinement, scalability, and compliance with applicable defense and regulatory standards.
